Command Line Interface
======================

Nameko ships with a command line interface to make hosting and interacting with services as easy as possible.

Running a Service
-----------------

.. code-block:: shell

    $ nameko run <module>[:<ServiceClass>]

Discover and run a service class. This will start the service in the foreground and run it until the process terminates.

It is possible to override the default settings using a ``--config`` switch

.. code-block:: shell

    $ nameko run --config ./foobar.yaml <module>[:<ServiceClass>]


and providing a simple YAML configuration file:

.. code-block:: yaml

    # foobar.yaml

    AMQP_URI: 'pyamqp://guest:guest@localhost'
    WEB_SERVER_ADDRESS: '0.0.0.0:8000'
    rpc_exchange: 'nameko-rpc'
    max_workers: 10
    parent_calls_tracked: 10

    LOGGING:
        version: 1
        handlers:
            console:
                class: logging.StreamHandler
        root:
            level: DEBUG
            handlers: [console]


The ``LOGGING`` entry is passed to :func:`logging.config.dictConfig` and should conform to the schema for that call.


Interacting with running services
---------------------------------

.. code-block:: pycon

    $ nameko shell

Launch an interactive python shell for working with remote nameko services. This is a regular interactive interpreter, with a special module ``n`` added
to the built-in namespace, providing the ability to make RPC calls and dispatch events.

Making an RPC call to "target_service":

.. code-block:: pycon

    $ nameko shell
    >>> n.rpc.target_service.target_method(...)
    # RPC response


Dispatching an event as "source_service":

.. code-block:: pycon

    $ nameko shell
    >>> n.dispatch_event("source_service", "event_type", "event_payload")
